Getting Started
Here’s how to download this problem into your own CS50 IDE. Log into CS50 IDE and then, in a terminal window, execute each of the below.

Execute cd to ensure that you’re in ~/ (i.e., your home directory, aka ~).
If you haven’t already, execute mkdir pset6 to make (i.e., create) a directory called pset6 in your home directory.
Execute cd pset6 to change into (i.e., open) that directory.
Execute wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/psets/6/dna/dna.zip to download a (compressed) ZIP file with this problem’s distribution.
Execute unzip dna.zip to uncompress that file.
Execute rm dna.zip followed by yes or y to delete that ZIP file.
Execute ls. You should see a directory called dna, which was inside of that ZIP file.
Execute cd dna to change into that directory.
Execute ls. You should see a directory of sample databases and a directory of sample sequences.
